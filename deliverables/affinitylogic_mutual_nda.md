**3. Obligations.** Each receiving Party shall: (a) use Confidential Information only for the Purpose; (b) restrict disclosure to personnel with a strict need to know who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as this Agreement; (c) employ commercially reasonable safeguards (including administrative, technical, and physical controls) to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure; and (d) promptly notify the disclosing Party of any unauthorized disclosure or breach.

**4. Exclusions.** Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) was already known without restriction before disclosure; (b) becomes public through no fault of the receiving Party; (c) is independently developed without reference to the Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without confidentiality obligations.

**5. Compelled Disclosure.** If the receiving Party is required by law, regulation, subpoena, or court order to disclose Confidential Information, it shall (to the extent legally permitted) provide prompt written notice to the disclosing Party and reasonably cooperate to seek protective measures.

**6. Personal Data.** Where Confidential Information includes personal data subject to GDPR, POPIA, or similar legislation, the receiving Party shall process such data solely on documented instructions, implement appropriate security measures, and support the disclosing Party in meeting applicable data-subject rights, breach notifications, and record-keeping obligations.

**7. Ownership.** All Confidential Information remains the property of the disclosing Party. No license or transfer of intellectual property rights is granted other than a limited right to use Confidential Information for the Purpose.

**8. Term.** The confidentiality obligations commence on the Effective Date and continue for five (5) years following the later of the Effective Date or termination of the Parties' last commercial engagement, except for trade secrets, which remain protected until they enter the public domain through no fault of the receiving Party.
