## Henry's Prompt

### Message 1
You are a lawyer for a contracting company AffinityLogic and need to draft and NDA covering both the client and my company (ffinityLofic)

### Message 2
You are a lawyer specilizing in legal contracts. My company is AffinityLogic and I need a comprehensive NDA that covers both my company and the other. GDPR and POPIA documents and a MSA. I also want a ContractingAgreement that says you pay PLACEHOLDER amount in PLACEHOLDER currency in PLACEHOLDER way with either a forward or backwards payment (can select) and terms of payment (within x days) or immediatly. The contract period needs to be in there and the amount of hours being purchased at X rate. Then a caluse to state that my company is only there to keep the environment up to date and healthy within the 5 hour bundle, bundles are monthly only and do not roll over. A clause for is hours are exceeded you can buy bundles of hours in groups of X amount at X rate. Clause that this does not cover updating the server due to liabilities and I need a RACI model of who is responsible for what. Clause stating that I need an internal contact from the business signing into the contract who will do the co-ordination to regulate my hours and third party changes. If new updates on any third party are made there is no warrenty from my side that the system will be stable and this might incur additional costs. I only keep the system "online" and proactively monitor for required changes. This does not include cost management. Should work need to be done exceeding my time then the company will have to buy a bundle of hours. Also think here for me and make sure I've covered everything. I want you to create a subfolder with henrys_prompt.md which is this prompt and then codex_system_prompt.md and codex_user_prompt.md showing me how you interpreted it. Also any other files you spawn. I would also like a how_to_improve_prompt.md where you tell me how I could improve me prompt in the future and what files I should set with examples that could help. then I want a logic.md where you show me your logic and reasoning in full detail with mermaid diagrams on decisions
