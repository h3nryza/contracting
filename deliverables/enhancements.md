# Enhancements

1. **Service Catalogue Annex:** Add an annex classifying tasks eligible under the five-hour bundle versus out-of-scope work. This will curb ambiguity and allow the coordinator to make rapid decisions.
2. **Escalation Matrix:** Extend the RACI with a time-bound escalation ladder (e.g., response within four business hours) to reinforce accountability and reporting cadence.
3. **Change-Request Form Template:** Provide a reusable template for additional bundles or change orders, referencing Section 4 of the Contracting Agreement for seamless approvals.
4. **Risk Register Clause:** Embed a requirement that Client and AffinityLogic review a shared risk register each quarter, documenting remediation ownership and bundle impact.
5. **Security Control Schedule:** Summarize baseline controls (patch cadence, monitoring SLAs, backup responsibilities) in the MSA to show diligence during audits.
6. **Service Credit Mechanism:** Consider offering limited service credits when AffinityLogic fails to meet agreed response commitments, reinforcing commercial fairness while capping liability.
7. **Tooling Transparency:** Include an exhibit listing monitoring/automation tools and data residency, satisfying GDPR Article 28 and POPIA transparency expectations.
