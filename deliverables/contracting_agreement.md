This Contracting Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between AffinityLogic ("AffinityLogic") and __________________ ("Client"), collectively the "Parties," effective as of _____________ (the "Effective Date").

## 1. Purpose and Scope
AffinityLogic provides remote environment care services focused on system availability, proactive monitoring, configuration hygiene, and coordination with approved third parties. Services are constrained to the purchased support-hour bundles described in Section 3.

## 2. Term
The Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for an initial period of _____________ months (the "Contract Period"). Thereafter, it renews automatically for successive _____________-month terms unless either Party gives thirty (30) days' written notice prior to renewal.

## 3. Bundled Hours and Rates
- **Base Bundle:** Client purchases a recurring monthly bundle of five (5) hours at a rate of X rate ("Base Bundle"). Bundles are billed in advance for each calendar month, do not roll over, and expire at month-end.
- **Additional Bundles:** If Base Bundle hours are exceeded, Client may purchase supplemental bundles of X amount hours at X rate per bundle. Work beyond the Base Bundle shall not commence until the supplemental bundle is confirmed in writing.
- **Use of Hours:** Hours may only be applied to environment health activities (e.g., monitoring, patch planning, configuration audits) and coordination tasks expressly authorized under this Agreement.

## 4. Fees and Payment
- **Fees:** Client agrees to pay PLACEHOLDER amount in PLACEHOLDER currency via PLACEHOLDER way, either as a forward (prepaid) or backward (post-paid) payment structure, as selected here: __________________.
- **Payment Timing:** Invoices are due within ______ days of receipt, unless the Parties mark them as "Due Immediately." Late payments accrue interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed by South African law.

## 5. Service Constraints and Exclusions
1. AffinityLogic's role is limited to keeping the covered environment online, healthy, and compliant with agreed baselines using the purchased hours. AffinityLogic does **not** provide cost management, budgeting, or financial optimization services under this Agreement.
2. Bundled services exclude in-place upgrades or major server rebuilds unless separately scoped. Server operating-system updates are excluded due to associated liabilities; such work requires a separate project agreement.
3. AffinityLogic proactively monitors for required changes but offers no warranty that third-party updates or vendor releases will maintain system stability. Implementing such updates may incur additional bundles and is performed on a commercially reasonable-efforts basis.
4. If Client requires work exceeding the available hours, the Parties must execute an additional bundle purchase before work proceeds.

## 6. Client Responsibilities

- **Third-Party Coordination:** Client shall ensure third-party vendors provide necessary access and collaborate with AffinityLogic. Client bears responsibility for third-party configuration changes.
- **Change Notifications:** Client must promptly notify AffinityLogic of planned releases, infrastructure modifications, or vendor updates that may impact stability.
