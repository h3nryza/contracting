## Codex User Prompt Interpretation

- Draft legal artifacts as AffinityLogic's contract lawyer: a comprehensive mutual NDA, GDPR addendum, POPIA addendum, Master Services Agreement, and a detailed Contracting Agreement reflecting the company's managed-environment support bundles.
- Ensure all agreements explicitly state South African governing law, jurisdiction (High Court of South Africa, Gauteng Division), and compliance duties spanning legal, contractual, and regulatory perspectives.
- The Contracting Agreement must include placeholders for fee amount, currency, payment method, forward/backward billing selection, payment timing (within X days or immediate), contract period, bundle size (5-hour monthly, non-rollover), rate placeholders, additional bundle purchase mechanism, exclusions (e.g., server upgrades, cost management), RACI table, internal coordinator requirement, and statements about AffinityLogic's limited responsibilities and third-party update risks.
- Deliverables must reside in the new subfolder and include: `henrys_prompt.md`, `codex_system_prompt.md`, `codex_user_prompt.md`, `how_to_improve_prompt.md`, `logic.md`, every legal document, plus `recommendations.md`, `enhancements.md`, `whatnext.md`, `index.md`, a prompting-guidance document, and a `project_init` subfolder containing an example starter file.
- `recommendations.md` and `whatnext.md` must use clear, plain English. `logic.md` must detail reasoning steps with mermaid diagrams; `how_to_improve_prompt.md` offers guidance on crafting better prompts; the new prompting-guidance files explain how the user can structure future requests and initial project files.
