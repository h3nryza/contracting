# Master Services Agreement

This Master Services Agreement ("MSA") is entered into by and between AffinityLogic ("Service Provider") and __________________ ("Client"), effective as of _____________ (the "Effective Date").

## 1. Scope of Services
Service Provider shall deliver managed environment services, which may include proactive monitoring, configuration management, routine health checks, incident triage, and advisory services as detailed in one or more Statements of Work (each, an "SOW"). The Parties may execute additional SOWs referencing this MSA, and each SOW shall set forth deliverables, service levels, fees, and schedules.

## 2. Order of Precedence
In the event of a conflict, the following order governs: (1) a duly executed SOW, (2) this MSA, (3) any incorporated policies such as the GDPR DPA or POPIA Addendum, and (4) ancillary documents.

## 3. Term and Termination
This MSA commences on the Effective Date and continues until terminated by either Party with thirty (30) days' written notice, unless a SOW specifies a longer commitment. Either Party may terminate for cause if the other materially breaches and fails to cure within fifteen (15) days after written notice. Termination does not relieve Client of paying accrued fees or confirmed bundles.

## 4. Fees and Payment
Fees are set out in each SOW or Contracting Agreement. Unless stated otherwise, invoices are due within fifteen (15) days of receipt. Late payments accrue interest at 1.5% per month (or the maximum allowed by law). Client is responsible for all applicable taxes, excluding taxes on Service Provider's income.

## 5. Service Levels and Constraints
Service Provider's responsibility is limited to maintaining the covered environment's health within the contracted support hours. Service Provider does not assume responsibility for third-party licensing, cost optimization, or unsupported customizations. Additional work requires new bundles or change orders.

## 6. Client Responsibilities
Client shall: (a) provide timely access to systems, documentation, and decision-makers; (b) designate a qualified internal coordinator to manage requests and approve time usage; (c) ensure third-party vendors cooperate with Service Provider; and (d) maintain compliant licensing for all software and infrastructure.

## 7. Change Control
Any material changes to scope, timelines, or requirements must be mutually documented. Service Provider may suspend work until changes and related fees are agreed in writing.

## 8. Intellectual Property
Each Party retains all pre-existing intellectual property ("IP"). Deliverables created by Service Provider specifically for Client under a SOW become Client-owned upon full payment, excluding Service Provider's pre-existing IP, tools, or templates, which remain Service Provider's property. Service Provider grants Client a non-exclusive license to use embedded IP solely for internal purposes.

## 9. Warranties and Disclaimers
Service Provider warrants that it will perform services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 10. Indemnities
Each Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold the other harmless from third-party claims arising from (i) its negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) breach of confidentiality, or (iii) infringement of IP rights by materials provided by the indemnifying Party, subject to limitations stated herein.

## 11. Limitation of Liability
NEITHER PARTY IS LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. EACH PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS MSA SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, EXCEPT FOR UNPAID FEES, BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS.

## 12. Confidentiality and Data Protection
The Parties shall execute and adhere to the Mutual NDA, GDPR DPA, and POPIA Addendum as applicable. Each Party will implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards aligned with South African best practices and international standards.

## 13. Force Majeure
Neither Party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control, provided the affected Party notifies the other and uses diligent efforts to resume performance.

## 14. Independent Contractors
The Parties are independent contractors. Nothing herein creates a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship.

## 15. Governing Law
This MSA is governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa. The Parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the High Court of South Africa (Gauteng Division, Johannesburg).

## 16. Notices
All notices must be in writing and delivered to the addresses specified below or as updated by written notice. Electronic notices are acceptable if receipt is confirmed.

## 17. Assignment
Neither Party may assign this MSA without the other's consent, except to a successor in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided the assignee agrees in writing to be bound.

## 18. Compliance with Laws
Each Party shall comply with all applicable legislation, regulations, and industry codes in South Africa, including POPIA, the Companies Act, the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, anti-corruption statutes, and any sector-specific directives that govern the services. Client shall promptly advise Service Provider of regulatory obligations unique to its industry. Service Provider shall make commercially reasonable efforts to align services to such obligations when within scope.

## 19. Entire Agreement
This MSA, together with its SOWs and incorporated documents, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes prior discussions. Amendments must be in writing and signed by authorized representatives.
