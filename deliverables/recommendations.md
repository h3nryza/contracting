# Recommendations (Plain English)

1. **Talk to a South African Lawyer.** Ask a local attorney to read these agreements so they match South African rules and your industry duties.
2. **Note Other Countries.** If you sign clients outside South Africa, make a short add-on for their laws, currencies, and tax/payment quirks so nothing is missed.
3. **Track Access.** Keep a simple log of who can reach each client system and refer to it in your SOWs to prove least-privilege access.
4. **Plan for Incidents.** Write a short POPIA-ready incident guide (who calls whom, within how long) and mention it in future SOWs.
5. **Watch Bundle Time.** Use a time-tracking sheet or tool that shows how many hours remain in the bundle and email weekly updates to the client's coordinator.
6. **List Subprocessors.** Maintain a live list of all tools/vendors you rely on (cloud, monitoring, ticketing) and share updates per the GDPR/POPIA addenda.
7. **Map Policies.** Create a one-pager showing how each document (NDA, DPA, POPIA, MSA, Contract Agreement) lines up with your internal controls so audits go faster.
