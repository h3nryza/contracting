# Project Init Template (Example)

## Purpose
Use this template when kicking off a new AffinityLogic contracting pack so every contributor knows the scope, files, and review steps from day one.

## File Checklist
- `README.md` — one-paragraph summary of what documents are needed and why.
- `requirements.md` — bullet list of legal clauses, placeholders, and compliance notes (list each document separately).
- `timeline.md` — milestones for drafting, legal review, client review, and signature.
- `glossary.md` — definitions for recurring terms (e.g., "Bundle", "Coordinator", "Forward Payment").
- `deliverables/` — folder where all drafted documents and meta files will live.

## Task Tracker (sample)
| Task | Owner | Due Date | Status |

| Draft NDA & MSA | Legal | 2024-05-10 | In Progress |
| Build Contracting Agreement | Legal Ops | 2024-05-11 | Not Started |

## Notes for Prompts
- Reference this file directly in future prompts so the agent knows which base files exist (e.g., "See `project_init/project_init.md` for starter structure").
- Update the table as tasks move so the status is accurate before each handoff.
