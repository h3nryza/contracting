# GDPR Data Processing Addendum

This GDPR Data Processing Addendum ("DPA") supplements any existing or future agreement (the "Agreement") between AffinityLogic ("Processor") and __________________ ("Controller") when Processor handles personal data governed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR"). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement or GDPR.

## 1. Subject Matter, Duration, Nature, and Purpose of Processing
- **Subject Matter:** Managed infrastructure, environment monitoring, platform management, and related professional services performed by Processor on behalf of Controller.
- **Duration:** For the term of the Agreement plus any legally required retention period.
- **Nature and Purpose:** Hosting, monitoring, maintenance, configuration, and performance optimization to keep Controller's environment online and healthy.
- **Types of Personal Data:** System user identifiers, contact details, access logs, configuration metadata, and other data provided or generated within Controller's environment.
- **Categories of Data Subjects:** Controller's employees, contractors, end users, customers, and other individuals whose data Controller processes through the services.

## 2. Roles and Instructions
Controller appoints Processor to process personal data solely for the purposes described above and in accordance with documented instructions. Processor shall immediately inform Controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes GDPR.

## 3. Processor Obligations
Processor shall:
1. Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including access controls, encryption, network segmentation, logging, and incident response procedures.
2. Ensure personnel accessing personal data are bound by confidentiality obligations.
3. Assist Controller in fulfilling obligations regarding data subject rights, impact assessments, and consulting supervisory authorities.
4. Notify Controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach and provide cooperation needed for Controller to meet notification requirements.
5. Maintain records of processing activities and make them available to Controller upon request.
6. Make available all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance and allow for audits conducted by Controller or an agreed third party, provided audits occur with reasonable notice and do not disrupt Processor operations.

## 4. Subprocessors
Processor may engage subprocessors for infrastructure hosting, monitoring, ticketing, or support services. Processor shall:
- Maintain an up-to-date list of subprocessors.
- Impose obligations on subprocessors that are substantially similar to this DPA.
- Remain fully liable for subprocessors' performance.
Controller may subscribe to receive notice of new subprocessors and object on reasonable grounds. If Processor cannot accommodate an objection, Controller may terminate the affected services.

## 5. International Transfers
Processor shall not transfer personal data outside the EEA/UK/South Africa without implementing appropriate safeguards such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, UK International Data Transfer Addendum, or binding corporate rules and shall provide evidence of such safeguards upon request.

## 6. Return or Deletion
Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Processor shall delete or return all personal data per Controller's instructions, unless retention is required by law. Any retained data will remain protected in accordance with this DPA.

## 7. Liability and Order of Precedence
Each Party's liability under this DPA is subject to the limitations and exclusions in the Agreement unless prohibited by law. In the event of conflict between this DPA and other Agreement terms relating to personal data, this DPA prevails.

## 8. Governing Law
This DPA is governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa, without prejudice to mandatory protections afforded by GDPR. The Parties agree to the jurisdiction of the High Court of South Africa (Gauteng Division, Johannesburg) for disputes arising from this DPA, while acknowledging that data-subject rights and regulator oversight may also invoke EU/UK authorities.
